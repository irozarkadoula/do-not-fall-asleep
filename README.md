# Do-not-fall-asleep

An openCV project that implements an algorithm that detects driver's state state of drowsiness by analyzing the image captured by video camera and notifies him if he is sleepy.

# Stages
- Live image acquisition
- Driver's identification
- Face detection
- Eyes/mouth detection
- Analysis
- Decision on driver's state of drowsiness
- Alarm notificition whenever he is sleepy

# Implementation
Implemented using OpenCV in Python
